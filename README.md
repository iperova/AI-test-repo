# Scam message classifier

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify outbound communication (email, text message) as either 'Scam-risk' or 'Safe'.

We use training data from serveral sources:
- 4,353 sample bad emails from Honeypot (https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot)
- 7,328 sample bad emails from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails)
- 16 sample bad synthetic emails from Gemini Pro
- 1 bad email from KWRI (ETH example from Jake)
- 6,133 good emails from KWRI
- Future iterations may include knowing Phishing attempts stored in KWRI's Zendesk instance

We preprocess sample data that may contain plain text, HTLM, and/or email formatts:
- HTML sanitizer
	* Remove unwanted elements and their content: style, script, links, images
    * Remove empty tags
    * Remove unnecessary attributes from allowed tags (src, hfref, alt, title, name, id, class)
- Email
    * Keep BODY and SUBJECT
- Text scrubbing
    * Unidecode
	* Whitespace

Our Model blueprint
- Generate text variables (ex: N-gams)
- Matrix of word-gram occurrences using tfidf
- Slim Residual Neural Network Classifier (but this method is almost indistinguishable in performance from other methods like Elastic-Net classifier, Na√Øve Bayes, etc.)

Initial performance on Cross-validation & Holdout data
- Sensitivity (Recall) - 0.9985
- Precision (PPV) - 0.9981
- Accuracy - 0.9971
- F1 - 0.9983

Needs exposure to real KWRI volumes for better out-of-sample testing.  Therefore anticipate need for additional training data & tuning

The model is exposed as an API deployed on DataRobot SaaS and may be accssed via webrequests and/or curl.

    ```
